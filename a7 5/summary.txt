Time spent on the assignment, in hours:15

Implementation strategy:
    (describe how you went about implementing the assignment and how the work was divided between the partners.)
    I broke it down step by step, and spend lots of time trying to think out how I wanted to implement each method,
    and the coded it after having a good idea of the implementation algorithm.

Testing strategy:
    (how did you perform testing and design test cases to achieve coverage?).
    I made sure to test things thoroughly after having issues with it. I purposely added tests to ensure
    the bugs I initially had, and unique corner cases were addressed and solved.

Known problems:
    (are there any things that do not work?)
    Nope.

Comments on the assignment: I enjoyed the assignment, I liked the structure and it was very engaging.
