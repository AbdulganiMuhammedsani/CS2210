Implementation strategy:
    (describe how you went about implementing the assignment and how the work was divided between the partners.)
    I was aware of the potential of issues to cascade, so I created lots of helper methods during the implementation.

Testing strategy:
    (how did you perform testing and design test cases to achieve coverage?)
    I also printed out components to visualize what was going on and what paths were traversed by my code.
Known problems:
    (are there any things that do not work?) Nope. No problems.

Comments on the assignment:I felt that it was a little more time consuming then other projects, and I had
more trouble understanding the specifications.
